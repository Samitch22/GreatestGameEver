We are currently updating version 2.0 of the Greatest Game Ever system. The Greatest Game Ever system is a word search puzzle game that plays like traditional word searches. In version 2.0, the entire word bank is displayed and shows the words you have found. There are distractions throughout the game as well as sounds. If a selection is made that does not find a word, the screen blows up.
